# Catch and Release Front End Assessment

Hey all, thanks for reviewing my project!

- Build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Tested with [Vite](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest)

I utilized the recommended [Countries](https://countries.trevorblades.com/) GraphQL API

The project can be run by cloning this repo or using the Docker image. If you choose to clone, here are the steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `npm run dev` to run the project
4. `npm run test` to run the unit tests

I am exhausted, so I will try to update this documentation more in the very near future.
